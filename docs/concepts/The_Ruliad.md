# The Ruliad: An Analytic Survey of Computational Totality and the Physicalization of Formal Systems

The investigation into the fundamental nature of reality has historically vacillated between the dual poles of material reductionism and mathematical Platonism. However, recent developments within the Wolfram Physics Project have introduced a third paradigm: the ruliad. This structure is defined as the entangled limit of everything that is computationally possible, representing the ultimate result of following all possible computational rules in all possible ways.[1, 2] The ruliad serves as a unique, ultimately inevitable, and necessary formal object that requires no outside input or choices, as it inherently contains all formal possibilities within its architecture.[1, 2] Unlike a specific mathematical theory or a particular physical model which requires the selection of specific axioms or laws, the ruliad encapsulates the totality of all such systems, tracing the entangled consequences of progressively applying every conceivable rule to every possible state.[1, 2]

The ontology of the ruliad rests on the principle that the universe is not merely governed by computation but is itself a manifestation of the computational process. At the lowest level, this structure is composed of "atoms of existence" termed emes.[3] These emes represent the raw material of the physical universe when interpreted by a physical observer and the ultimate elements of mathematical constructs when interpreted by a mathematical observer.[3] This conceptual framework suggests that the ruliad is not a representation of reality but is the actual substance of which everything is made.[3] The transition from the discrete, abstract rules of the ruliad to the continuous, coherent experience of the physical world is mediated by the observer, whose computational limitations and specific methods of perception filter the infinite complexity of the ruliad into a manageable and stable narrative.[4, 5, 6]

## Foundations of Rulial Space and Multiway Dynamics

The structural integrity of the ruliad is derived from the dynamics of multiway systems. In a standard multiway system, a single rule is applied in all possible ways to a given state, leading to a branching graph of possible histories.[1, 7] The ruliad extends this concept to the extreme case of non-determinism: the rulial multiway system, also referred to as an ultramultiway graph.[7, 8] In this system, not only are rules applied in all possible ways, but all possible rules are applied to every state.[5, 7] This process generates a vast, interconnected web of transitions where paths branch as different rules are applied and merge when different computational paths reach equivalent states, such as isomorphic hypergraphs or identical symbolic expressions.[1, 2, 8]

## The Geometry of Rule-Space

The space defined by the transitions of a rulial multiway system is known as rulial space.[7, 8] To understand its topography, research has utilized simple models such as Turing machines. In a rulial multiway graph of Turing machines, each node represents a distinct configuration of the tape, head position, and internal state.[7] The arrows between nodes represent the application of specific micro-rules. For a Turing machine with s states and k colors, there are 2sk possible successors for every node, assuming the head moves one square left or right.[7]

## The fundamental units of transition in rulial space

The limiting structure of these graphs as the number of steps approaches infinity exhibits vertex-transitivity, meaning the graph is homogeneous and appears identical from any node.[7] For systems with k=1, the space behaves as a one-dimensional manifold; however, for k≥2, the rulial space becomes effectively infinite-dimensional, with the volume of geodesic balls growing exponentially with their radius.[7] This dimensionality suggests that rulial space is not a simple container but a dense, complex fabric where the connectivity is determined by the computational equivalence of different rule sequences.[7]

## The Principle of Computational Equivalence

Central to the uniqueness of the ruliad is the Principle of Computational Equivalence. The principle posits that almost all rules that do not show obviously simple behavior lead to computations that are equivalent in their sophistication.[1] This implies that there is only one ultimate equivalence class for computations, ensuring that the ruliad, as the limit of all possible rules, is a singular and unique object.[1, 6] Causal invariance—the property where all possible evolution paths in a multiway system yield isomorphic causal networks—plays a critical role here.[8, 9] In the rulial multiway graph, causal invariance ensures that regardless of the specific rules or reference frames an observer chooses, the underlying causal structure of the universe remains consistent.[7, 10, 11]

## The Three Levels of Computational Space

The Wolfram Physics Project categorizes the universe into three distinct yet interrelated levels of description, each corresponding to a different type of space. These levels represent a hierarchy of abstraction, moving from the specific physical manifestations of rules to the totality of all possible rules.

### Physical Space and Hypergraph Rewriting

Physical space is the first level of the model, described by spatial hypergraphs where nodes represent atoms of space and hyperedges represent relations between them.[7, 12, 13] The evolution of these hypergraphs occurs through rewriting rules, which are transformations applied to the relations. In this context, space is not a passive background but is itself a dynamic structure formed by the connectivity of the hypergraph.[12, 14, 15] Spacetime emerges as the large-scale limit of the causal graph, which records the relationships between updating events.[8, 9, 13]

### Branchial Space and Quantum Entanglement

Branchial space arises from the multiway system of a single rule. It is formed by the transversals of the multiway graph, connecting states that share a common ancestor in the previous step.[7, 9, 16] These connections represent entanglements between quantum states.[9, 17] The branchial graph serves as a map of quantum entanglements, where distance in the graph corresponds to the degree of common ancestry and correlation between states.[9, 16, 18] This level of description accounts for the non-deterministic nature of quantum mechanics, viewing it as a manifestation of the branching paths within a multiway system.[13, 17, 18]

### Rulial Space and Rule-Space Relativity

Rulial space is the most general level, representing the space of all possible rules.[7] "Movement" in rulial space corresponds to a change in the description language or the set of rules an observer uses to interpret the universe.[2, 10] Just as physical space has a speed of light (c) and branchial space has a maximum entanglement rate, rulial space possesses a maximum emulation speed (ρ), which limits how quickly one description of the universe can be translated into another.[2, 7] This lead to the concept of rule-space relativity, where different observers attribute different underlying rules to the universe based on their own internal computational structure, yet all find equivalent fundamental laws due to the principle of computational equivalence.[7, 10]

## The Observer Theory: Boundedness and the Emergence of Law

One of the most profound insights of the ruliad framework is that physical laws are not intrinsic properties of the universe but are consequences of how observers like us sample the ruliad.[2, 4, 19] This shift from an objective view from nowhere to an observer-centric model places the characteristics of the observer at the heart of physical law.[4, 20]

### Computational Boundedness and Persistence

A human-like observer is defined by two primary constraints: computational boundedness and a belief in the persistence of the self and the world.[6, 21] Because the ruliad contains infinite computational detail, a bounded observer cannot track every individual eme or every possible branch of history.[4, 5, 19] Instead, the observer must perform a coarse-graining of the underlying computations, aggregating vast numbers of discrete events into stable, symbolic concepts.[5, 21, 22]
This coarse-graining is essential for coherence. For a coherent observer to exist, they must assume that the world they perceive is consistent over time and space.[21, 23, 24] This leads to the belief in persistence, where the observer identifies persistent structures in the ruliad—such as atoms, molecules, or planets—and treats them as distinct, stable entities.[21, 25] The laws of physics, then, are the regularities that remain invariant across the different ways a bounded observer can sample the ruliad.[4, 5]

Foliation and Reference Frames
Observers navigate the ruliad by choosing a foliation, which is a way of slicing the multiway graph into successive moments of time.[8, 18, 26] This choice of foliation determines the observer's perspective on physical and quantum phenomena.
• In Physical Space, different foliations of the causal graph correspond to different inertial reference frames in special relativity.[5, 7]
• In Branchial Space, foliations correspond to quantum observation frames, which determine how an observer perceives the superposition of quantum states.[7, 18]
• In Rulial Space, foliations correspond to rulial description frames, representing the choice of computational language or rules used to describe reality.[7]
The fact that different observers in different frames perceive the same underlying physical laws is a result of causal invariance.[7, 10] This leads to rule-space relativity, suggesting that the specific rule we think the universe follows is merely a choice of coordinate system in the ruliad.[7, 10]

### The Self-Observation Problem and Reflexivity

A significant conceptual challenge within this framework is the fact that the observer is themselves a part of the ruliad.[4, 6] This is a story of self-observation, where a sub-computation within the ruliad attempts to model the ruliad as a whole.[6, 19, 23] Because the system as a whole is not a strict observable for a sub-system, the observer's map and the territory of reality are effectively conjoined.[4, 8] This reflexivity implies that the laws of physics we discover are as much a description of our own cognitive and perceptual architecture as they are a description of the outside world.[20, 23]

### Metamathematics and the Higher Categorical Formalization

The ruliad does not only encompass the physical universe; it also serves as the foundation for all possible mathematics. This perspective, termed the physicalization of metamathematics, suggests that the structure of mathematical systems can be analyzed using the same tools as the Wolfram Physics Project.[3, 4, 27, 28]

### Mathematics as a Sliced Ruliad

Human mathematics is viewed as a tiny path or a humanized slice of the infinite ruliad.[3, 22, 29] Just as physics emerges from the coarse-graining of emes into atoms of space, mathematics emerges from the coarse-graining of emes into mathematical constructs like integers or groups.[3, 25] The metamathematical space is modeled using entailment graphs, where nodes are mathematical statements and edges are the proof steps connecting them.[26, 30] A proof of a theorem is then a geodesic path through this space.[26]

### Infinity-Groupoids and Topos Theory

To provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for the ruliad, researchers have turned to higher category theory. The rulial multiway system, in its infinite limit, is identified as an ∞-groupoid.[12] This identification aligns with Grothendieck's homotopy hypothesis, which posits an equivalence between topological spaces and ∞-groupoids.[8, 12] Furthermore, the classifying space of rulial multiway systems—a multiverse of all possible computational systems—is shown to carry the formal structure of an (∞,1)-topos.[12] This higher-order categorical structure allows for the functorial inheritance of spatial and geometric properties from pregeometric, type-theoretic constructions, potentially removing the need for a priori background assumptions in physics.[12]

## Formalized Proofs and Alien Knowledge

The exploration of alien regions of the ruliad is exemplified by automated theorem proving. Stephen Wolfram's identification of the simplest possible axiom for Boolean algebra involved a 104-step proof that is described as long, complicated, and fiddly, reminiscent of machine code.[29, 30, 31] This highlights a core tension: while the ruliad contains all possible truths, most of these truths lack the human-scale narrative structure that allows for intuitive understanding.[30, 31] The future of mathematics may involve navigating these wilds of metamathematical space using AI as an interface to translate alien computations into human-accessible concepts.[29, 30, 31]

### Unification of General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics

The central ambition of the Wolfram Physics Project is to provide a unified framework for the two pillars of modern physics: General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics. In the ruliad model, these two theories emerge from the same underlying discrete structure, viewed through different types of observation frames.[27, 32, 33]

### General Relativity from Causal Graphs

In the discrete model, gravity is a manifestation of the curvature of the causal graph.[13] The flux of edges through spacelike hypersurfaces in the causal graph is associated with energy and momentum.[9, 18] When the updating rules satisfy causal invariance, the large-scale limit of the causal graph is shown to satisfy the Einstein field equations.[13, 34] In this view, mass is a manifestation of persistent computational structures that deflect the paths of geodesics in the hypergraph, much as mass curves spacetime in traditional general relativity.[5, 26]

### Quantum Mechanics from Multiway Systems

Quantum mechanics emerges from the multiway nature of the rules. A multiway graph represents a quantum circuit cosmology where different branches correspond to different possible histories of the universe.[9, 17]
• Superposition: Branchlike-separated states in the multiway graph correspond to quantum states in superposition.[9]
• Entanglement: The connections in the branchial graph represent entanglements between quantum states.[9, 16, 17]
• Measurement: A quantum observation frame is a choice of foliation that collapses the multiway branching into a definite, classical sequence of events.[13, 18]

The unification is achieved because both general relativity and quantum mechanics are properties of the same multiway causal structure. Curvature in physical space corresponds to gravity, while curvature in branchial space corresponds to quantum effects.[18, 32] Recent work has even suggested a fundamental universal ratio, E/m=c2=(d/t)2, which prevents mathematical singularities and maintains finite ratios for energy, mass, and density throughout all of spacetime.[32]

### Ruliology: The Experimental Science of Rules

The study of the ruliad has given rise to a new discipline termed ruliology.[4, 35, 36] Ruliology is an experimental and basic science that explores what simple computational rules do, regardless of their immediate application to physics or biology.[35, 37]

### The Source of Complexity and Computational Irreducibility

Ruliology focuses on setting up abstract rules—such as cellular automata, Turing machines, or string substitution systems—and visualizing their behavior.[35, 36] It is the study of the computational universe of possible programs.[1, 7, 37] One of the core discoveries of ruliology is that even the simplest rules can generate immense complexity, a phenomenon that is often computationally irreducible.[12, 34, 35] Computational irreducibility means that there is no shortcut to finding out what a system will do; one must simply run the computation and see the result.[34, 35, 38]

### Applications and Meta-Modeling

Ruliology provides the raw material for building models of complex systems. While traditional science often starts with a model and drills down to see what is underneath (meta-modeling), ruliology builds up from minimal foundations to see what can happen.[35, 36]

• In Biology, ruliology is used to understand how simple rules can lead to intricate biological patterns or the dynamics of evolution.[28, 36, 39]

• In Economics, the economics of observation within the ruliad examines how resource constraints like finite energy and memory shape the laws of exchange and value.[5]

• In Artificial Intelligence, ruliological principles help in understanding the behavior of large neural networks and the irreducible nature of machine learning processes.[28, 34]

### Critical Perspectives and Epistemological Challenges

Despite its ambitious scope and internal coherence, the ruliad framework has faced significant criticism from the established scientific community. These critiques range from methodological objections to fundamental philosophical disagreements.

### Methodological and Personal Critiques

A primary point of contention is Stephen Wolfram's methodology, particularly his refusal to follow the traditional academic path of peer review.[40, 41] Critics such as Sean Carroll have noted that the sheer volume of the theory makes it difficult for specialists to engage with or verify.[40] Freeman Dyson famously dismissed the project as grand, improbable theories typical of scientists in their later years.[40] Other common critiques include the overblown nature of the claims, the lack of quantitative predictions compared to standard physics textbooks, and accusations of failing to sufficiently credit predecessors in computational physics.[40, 41, 42]

### Epistemological and Philosophical Concerns

More fundamental challenges involve the epistemological status of the ruliad. Some argue that the ruliad is unfalsifiable—if a theory contains every possible rule, then the statement that the universe follows the ruliad becomes vacuous.[23, 24] Philosophically, the observer theory is seen by some as a radical and perhaps problematic epistemology. By making physical law dependent on the observer, the model must explain why different humans share a common sampling of the ruliad and why we remain localized in space and time, which are often treated as brute facts within the model.[23, 24]

### Alternative Paradigms: The Hoffman Debate

The ruliad model is frequently compared to Donald Hoffman’s User Interface Theory of Perception.[43, 44, 45, 46] While both agree that physical reality is an interface or a headset that hides a deeper complexity, they differ on the nature of that complexity. Wolfram’s ruliad posits computational totality as the foundation, with consciousness being an emergent property of simple rules.[43] In contrast, Hoffman’s model of conscious agents suggests that consciousness is fundamental and physical reality emerges from the interactions of these agents.[43, 45] This debate highlights the tension between computation-first and consciousness-first ontologies, with Hoffman arguing that consciousness cannot be derived from non-conscious computational elements.[43, 45, 47]

### Implications for Artificial Intelligence and Synthetic Observers

The rise of Large Language Models and advanced AI provides a new lens through which to view the ruliad. AI systems can be thought of as alien observers that sample the ruliad in ways that differ significantly from human perception.[29, 34]

### LLMs and the "Texture" of Knowledge

A distinction is drawn between the human-like minds of LLMs and formal computational knowledge.[29, 48] LLMs are described as concentrating on the human texture of knowledge—recognizing patterns in natural language and published mathematics that humans find interesting.[29, 48] However, the vast majority of the ruliad is alien and non-human, filled with computations that LLMs cannot easily navigate because they lack the formal, symbolic structure of a computational telescope.[29]

### AI as an Interface to the Ruliad

The future of AI may involve its role as an interface between the alien computational universe and human understanding.[34, 48] By automating the navigation of metamathematical space or the search for technologically useful programs in the ruliological landscape, AI can widen the lens of what we perceive.[29, 34] However, the computational irreducibility of the ruliad implies that even super-intelligent AIs cannot jump ahead of the universe’s evolution; they must still run the computations step-by-step.[34, 38]

### Conclusion: The Horizon of Computational Totality

The concept of the ruliad represents a radical shift in the quest for a fundamental theory of existence. By positing that the universe is the entangled limit of all possible computations, it offers a framework that integrates physics, mathematics, and philosophy into a single, cohesive structure.[1, 6, 27, 44] The emergence of physical laws as observer effects suggests that the coherence of our world is not a property of the rules themselves but of our own computational boundedness and need for persistence.[4, 6, 21]

While the ruliad remains a controversial and largely unverified construct within mainstream academia, its internal logic provides a provocative set of answers to ancient questions about why the universe exists and why it follows the laws it does.[20, 23, 28, 40] The uniqueness of the ruliad, guaranteed by the principle of computational equivalence, implies that we are not living in one of many possible universes, but are rather sampling one of many possible views of the single, inevitable computational totality.[1, 2, 6]

As ruliology matures as an experimental science and as AI tools provide new ways to explore the metamathematical landscape, the ruliad may eventually move from a work of art and a totality metaphor into a rigorous foundation for the next generation of theoretical science.[4, 20, 35] Whether it will succeed in providing the definitive machine code of the universe remains to be seen, but its role in transforming metaphysical inquiries into formal, testable frameworks marks a significant milestone in the evolution of computational thought.[13, 39, 49]

### Technical Deep Dive: Hypergraph Rewriting and Causal Structure

To understand the mechanics of the ruliad, one must examine the underlying hypergraph rewriting systems. These systems are based on the application of transformation rules to sets of relations.[13, 14] A rule specifies a left-hand side pattern and a right-hand side replacement. When the pattern matches a part of the spatial hypergraph, that part is updated according to the replacement.

### Multiway Systems and Isomorphism Checking

The multiway system for hypergraph rewriting includes a separate path for every possible updating event. Unlike string substitution systems where states are compared for identity, hypergraph systems must determine if states are isomorphic.[7, 13] Hypergraph isomorphism checking is structurally identical to graph isomorphism, ensuring that states are treated as equivalent regardless of how their nodes are labeled. This merging of isomorphic states is what creates the entangled structure of the ruliad.[1, 2, 8]

Causal Invariance and Relativistic Covariance
Causal invariance is a property where the causal graph—the network of dependencies between events—is independent of the order in which rules are applied.[8, 9] In the Wolfram model, causal invariance is the source of relativistic invariance. It ensures that the causal relationship between events is preserved across different reference frames, corresponding to different choices of foliations in the multiway graph.[8, 9, 13]
Higher-Arity Science and Ternary Algebras

Recent research at the Wolfram Institute has extended these rewriting systems to higher-arity structures. While traditional graphs involve binary relations (arity 2), the project investigates ternary algebras and hypergraphs with higher-arity bonds.[13, 28] This higher-arity science aims to generalize the notion of symmetry in physical theories and provide a better understanding of forces like the strong nuclear force through the lens of hypergraph rewrites.[13, 28]

### The Physicalization of Metamathematics: A Systematic Review

The physicalization of metamathematics is the application of the ruliad framework to the foundations of mathematics. This approach treats mathematical theorems as physical objects and proofs as paths in a metamathematical space.[3, 26, 27]

### Metamodeling of Axiomatic Systems

Mathematics often begins with axioms, which are viewed in the ruliad as specific rules applied to initial symbolic expressions.[14, 27] The evolution of these axioms generates a multiway graph where each node is a mathematical statement. The connections in the branchial graph of this system define the metamathematical space, where distance represents the degree of common conceptual ancestry between theorems.[25, 26]

### The Machine Code of Mathematics: Combinators and Emes

Below the level of axioms lies the "ur-level" of computation. In the ruliad, all mathematical systems can be compiled down to raw machine code, such as S and K combinators.[25, 39] This suggests that there is no fundamental difference between the "stuff" of mathematics and the "stuff" of physics; both are emergent properties of the same underlying computational substrate.[3, 25]

### Empirical Metamathematics and Euclid’s Graph

Research into the empirical structure of mathematics involves analyzing historical texts like Euclid's Elements as a graph of theorems.[27] This empirical metamathematics explores the interdependence of theorems and identifies the "machine code" of Euclid—the foundational axioms and lemmas upon which the entire system is built.[27] This mirrors the ruliological study of simple rules, identifying which parts of the metamathematical ruliad have been populated by human mathematical activity.[3, 27]

### The Future of Ruliology and 2025-2026 Developments

As of early 2026, ruliology has expanded into several new domains, including medicine, biological evolution, and advanced computation services.[35, 37, 39]

### Ruliology of Lambdas and Formalized Medicine

Recent writings by Stephen Wolfram have explored the "Ruliology of Lambdas," investigating the computational behavior of lambda calculus within the ruliad.[28, 39] Additionally, the project has moved towards a computational formalization for the foundations of medicine, seeking to model physiological processes as multiway systems.[35, 39]

### Instant Supercompute and the Rulial Ensemble in Biology

To facilitate the massive calculations required to explore the ruliad, Wolfram Research launched "Wolfram Compute Services" in late 2025, providing instant supercomputing capabilities for ruliological research.[37, 39] In the biological sciences, the concept of the "Rulial Ensemble" is being used to understand bulk orchestration in life, viewing biological organisms as stable patterns within a wider computational landscape.[39]
