# Dark Matter as Oligons: Mapping the Tension Network to the Hypergraph

This document bridges the **Metastable Superfluid Membrane** theory with the **Wolfram Physics Project**, showing how "Dark Matter as tension gradient" maps to the concept of **Oligons** in hypergraph physics.

## The Core Mapping

| MSM Concept                | Wolfram Analog             | Mathematical Form                        |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Topological Defects**    | Oligons                    | Localized ~10¹ edge structures           |
| **Vacuum Stress Field**    | Discrete Spacetime Texture | Non-continuum hypergraph activity        |
| **Tension Gradient**       | Causal Flux                | $F_{DM} = \nabla \cdot \sigma_{tension}$ |
| **Cosmic Web Scaffolding** | Rulial Sedimentation       | Phase-transition frozen defects          |

## 1. Topological Defects as "Oligons"

**Dark Matter as topological defects** = **Oligons** in the hypergraph.

- **Definition:** Oligons are localized structures involving a small number of edges in the spatial hypergraph.
- **The Scaffolding:** Unlike electrons/protons (~10³⁵ hypergraph elements), oligons are smaller, lighter, and vastly more numerous.
- **Dark Matter Signal:** Too small to interact with coarse-grained matter, but collectively exert gravitational influence.

## 2. Dark Matter as the "Stress Field" of Space

**Proposition:** Dark Matter is not particles, but the stress field of the vacuum itself.

Wolfram's analogy: **The Caloric Fallacy**

- 19th century: Heat was thought to be a fluid ("caloric")
- Reality: Heat is molecular motion, not a substance
- **Dark Matter Parallel:** May not be a particle but a manifestation of spacetime's discrete structure

The "missing mass" is the **texture of the hypergraph** that hasn't smoothed into continuum geometry.

## 3. The Tension Gradient

$$F_{DM} = \nabla \cdot \sigma_{tension}$$

| MSM Term           | Wolfram Equivalent               | Meaning                            |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| $\sigma_{tension}$ | Causal flux density              | Mass/energy = flux of causal edges |
| $\nabla$           | Hypergraph connectivity gradient | Variation in defect density        |
| $F_{DM}$           | Geodesic deflection              | Gravity without standard matter    |

**Mechanism:**

1. Regions with higher oligon density create higher causal flux
2. Oligons deflect geodesics (shortest paths in causal graph)
3. The gradient of network activity **IS** the gravitational field
4. High vacuum stress → apparent excess mass → "Dark Matter"

## 4. The Cosmic Web as "Rulial Sedimentation"

**Phase Transition:**
As the universe computes forward, rules "crystallize." Where hypergraph knitting was imperfect, stable defects (oligons) remain.

**Invisible Skeleton:**
These defects cluster, forming a background structure (web) that:

- Dictates where ordinary matter can stably exist
- Acts as the gravitational skeleton of the universe
- Is invisible to electromagnetic detection

## Implementation in Rulial Navigator

| Physical Concept    | Code Implementation                                    |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Oligon detection    | `mining/extractor.py` - finds small, stable structures |
| Tension measurement | `compression/flow.py` - measures vacuum rigidity       |
| Causal flux         | `mapper/entailment.py` - causal graph construction     |
| Geodesic analysis   | `quantum/zx_reducer.py` - path simplification          |

### The Navigator's View

```
Oligons (small defects)     →   Still lifes, small oscillators
Electrons/Protons (knots)   →   Gliders, spaceships (10³⁵ elements analog)
Dark Matter Halo            →   Compression ratio gradient across rule space
Cosmic Web                  →   Class 4 filaments in the Atlas
```

## Implications for Classification

The compression flow analyzer measures the "vacuum stress":

| Signal         | Physical Meaning           | Oligon Density         |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| ❄️ BOREDOM     | No defects, smooth vacuum  | Zero                   |
| 🔥 FRUSTRATION | Chaotic, no stable defects | Maximal noise          |
| ✨ CURIOSITY   | **Stable oligon network**  | Structured, persistent |

**Class 4 = Rules where oligons form stable tension networks**

This is why Game of Life and HighLife register as CURIOSITY—they support stable, small structures (blocks, blinkers = oligons) that create the scaffolding for larger solitonic structures (gliders, spaceships = matter knots).

## Future Work

1. **Oligon Counter:** Enumerate small stable structures per rule
2. **Tension Field Visualization:** Map $\sigma_{tension}$ across the Atlas
3. **Causal Flux Metric:** Measure flux through entailment cones
4. **Geodesic Deflection:** Track how particles bend around oligon clusters
