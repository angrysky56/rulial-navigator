# Causal Invariance and the Convergence of Multiway Systems

Causal invariance fundamentally dictates the fate of branch pairs in a multiway system by guaranteeing their eventual convergence.

1. Guaranteeing Convergence In a multiway system, a "branch pair" is formed when a state has multiple possible updating events, causing the history of the system to split into different branches. Without causal invariance, these branches might remain independent and divergent. However, when causal invariance is present, it guarantees that whenever states split to form a branch pair, they will always merge again. This means that the different paths of history created by the branching will eventually converge to a common successor state.

2. Ensuring Consistent Causal History This merging process is critical for the stability of the system's causal structure. Causal invariance ensures that regardless of which branch or sequence of updating events is followed, the resulting causal graph—the network of causal relationships between events—remains isomorphic (identical in structure). Consequently, the graph of causal relationships is independent of the specific order in which rules are applied.

3. Physical Implications: Interference and Relativity The merging of branch pairs driven by causal invariance has specific physical interpretations in the Wolfram model:
   • Quantum Interference: Just as branching represents quantum superposition, the merging of branches is interpreted as quantum interference, where different quantum histories interact.
   • Objective Reality: Because the underlying causal graph is invariant regardless of the path taken, causal invariance allows for the existence of a coherent, objective reality. It ensures that different "reference frames" (or foliations of the system) describe the same fundamental physics, which is the basis for relativistic invariance.
   • Observer Consistency: This convergence allows computationally bounded observers to believe they exist in a single, persistent thread of time, as the diverging histories are knitted back together into a consistent narrative.
